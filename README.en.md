## Features

### A complete agent workspace

- Create, switch, rename, and delete sessions with continuously streamed responses
- Search and browse sessions by date while using stable titles in both the sidebar and conversation header
- Inspect tool calls, execution progress, and context compaction status
- Queue messages and use Steer or Follow-up interaction modes
- Quickly switch models, reasoning levels, tool presets, and notification sounds
- Attach images, run slash commands, and reference project files with `@`
- Keep chat and composer content aligned to one reading width, with a mouse- and keyboard-resizable file panel that remembers its width

### A built-in browser shared by the user and Agent

- Run real Chromium pages in a right-side Electron `WebContentsView`, with multiple tabs, temporary or persistent profiles, signed-in state, downloads, uploads, and proxy support
- Give the Agent separate Browser read/interact grants for navigation, structured snapshots, screenshots, clicks, typing, keys, and waits; the main window prompts on first use, and coding permissions never enable browsing implicitly
- Let the user and Agent operate the same page, with immediate user takeover and local policy or confirmation for submissions, downloads, uploads, permissions, and external protocols
- Manage global and per-session permanent permissions in Settings while authorization dialogs create temporary grants only for the current session; one local, launch-only switch controls Advanced Browser Mode
- Advanced Browser Mode combines consistent UA/Client Hints identity, trusted input, full CDP network capture and confirmed write replay, the JavaScript experience library, and dedicated advanced Profiles; Agent tools neither accept nor return cookie values
- Label private-network protection as best-effort; Strict mode fails closed until an enforcing network sandbox is deployed

### A project-focused file experience

- Select project directories natively and manage Git branches and worktrees
- Browse project files, open multiple tabs, download files, or reference them in prompts
- Render syntax-highlighted code, Mermaid, and KaTeX in Agent responses and Markdown files, and preview Word (`.docx`) documents
- Keep sessions aligned with the project through file watching and Git status awareness

### Unified model and extension management

- Bundle Pi Coding Agent 0.84.0 and manage model providers and model configurations
- Prefer the local model directory when sessions start; explicitly refresh the remote directory when needed while preserving cached models across offline, timeout, or partial-provider failures
- Sign in through browser-based OAuth flows
- Search for, install, and configure Skills; normal installs keep npm's default concurrency, with one isolated-cache retry for network, timeout, or cache-lock failures
- Manage Plugins while continuing to use the Pi Agent extension ecosystem

### Cross-platform developer tool management

- Discover and verify the user's existing Node.js/npm, Python, uv, Git/Bash, Bun, and jq installations, including common locations missing from a GUI launch PATH
- Give Skills, Plugins, Agent Bash, Git/worktree operations, and search tools one consistent set of absolute paths and per-process environments
- With explicit user confirmation, install Node.js LTS, CPython, uv, PortableGit, Bun, and jq into private application storage without changing the system PATH, shell profile, or registry
- Bundle manifest-verified ripgrep and fd binaries for the target platform so basic search remains available offline

### WeChat, Telegram, and Feishu/Lark channels

- Connect personal WeChat with QR login, Telegram with a BotFather token, or Feishu/Lark by creating a new bot through the official QR flow or supplying an existing app's App ID and App Secret
- Protect direct messages with pairing and Telegram or Feishu/Lark groups with allowlists and mention requirements; WeChat groups are not enabled yet, and remote tools are disabled by default
- Give each external conversation an isolated Pi Session by default, or bind it from the active desktop session to share history and context with the UI; the binding list stays within the window and scrolls internally when long
- Use an account's default tool grant for new dedicated channel sessions and synchronize saved changes to sessions already bound to that account; tool grants are Pi Session-scoped, so every channel entry point sharing one Session also shares one grant
- Send only the user's actual IM text as the model's user prompt; the desktop distinguishes sources with black local, green WeChat, blue Telegram, and orange Feishu/Lark user bubbles
- Receive images, files, and voice messages from WeChat, Telegram, and Feishu/Lark, plus Feishu/Lark video resources; images enter the model as multimodal input, while other attachments use an isolated staging area and WeChat SILK audio is converted to WAV when possible
- Stream previews in Telegram private chats and collapse reasoning and tool details
- Receive Feishu/Lark DMs, controlled groups, and threads through the official SDK long connection; Cards render Markdown, stream thinking and tool progress, and fold process details into the final response
- Show turn-status reactions on the source message in Telegram and Feishu/Lark; Feishu DMs can invoke `/help`, `/status`, `/new`, `/compact`, and `/reload` from a native bot menu

### Designed for long-running desktop use

- Single-instance behavior, system tray, desktop notifications, and Dock/taskbar badges
- Window-state persistence, system theme integration, and custom protocol handling
- Agent Host crash recovery, crash reports, and diagnostic exports
- Periodic or manual stable-release checks on enabled platforms, with user-approved downloads and restart installation after active tasks finish
- Electron `sandbox: true`, a strict Content Security Policy, and typed IPC contracts

## Quick start

### Use a desktop build

The latest stable version is [v0.1.8](https://github.com/sky390/pi-desktop/releases/tag/v0.1.8), with builds for macOS Apple Silicon and Intel, Windows x64, and Linux x64.

Pi Agent Desktop v0.1.8 bundles the Pi Coding Agent 0.84.0 runtime. Regular users do not need to install the Pi CLI, Pi Coding Agent, Node.js, or npm just to use the Agent. When a Skill, Plugin, or Agent script needs additional developer tools, the application first reuses healthy system installations and can install private runtimes after explicit user confirmation.

The application reads sessions and configuration from `~/.pi/agent/`. If you already use the Pi CLI, your existing data is available without migration. The desktop application also works if you have never used the CLI.

Pi Desktop first discovers and verifies the user's existing Node.js/npm, Python, Git, Bash, uv, jq, and Bun installations; bundled `rg` and `fd` keep search available offline.

### Desktop system requirements

- macOS 12 Monterey or later, on Apple Silicon (arm64) or Intel (x64)
- 64-bit Windows 10 or Windows 11 on x64; Windows 11 is recommended because it remains under regular security support
- A 64-bit Linux x64 AppImage on a modern glibc distribution with a graphical desktop session; updates are currently installed manually
- Windows 32-bit (x86) and Windows ARM64 installers are not currently provided

### Development requirements

- Node.js 22.19 or later
- npm, included with Node.js
- macOS, Windows, or Linux

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sky390/pi-desktop.git
cd pi-desktop
npm ci
npm run dev
```

### Builds

- macOS Apple Silicon (arm64): DMG and ZIP
- macOS Intel (x64): DMG and ZIP
- Windows (x64): NSIS installer
- Linux (x64): AppImage

## Architecture

Pi Agent Desktop uses a three-process Electron architecture to isolate privileged desktop capabilities, the Agent runtime, and the UI.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Main["Electron Main<br/>Window · tray · protocol · Host supervision"]
    Host["Agent Host / utilityProcess<br/>Pi Agent · sessions · files · configuration"]
    UI["Renderer<br/>React 19 · Vite"]
    Browser["Main-owned WebContentsView<br/>Remote pages · profiles · network policy"]
    Data["~/.pi/agent/<br/>Sessions · models · configuration"]

    Main --> Host
    Main --> UI
    Main --> Browser
    Host -->|"Revisioned Browser RPC"| Main
    UI <-->|"Typed MessagePort IPC"| Host
    Host <--> Data
```

- **Main** manages the window lifecycle, menus, tray, notifications, software updates, custom protocols, and Agent Host supervision
- **Agent Host** runs Pi Coding Agent in an isolated `utilityProcess` and handles sessions, files, configuration, and extensions
- **Renderer** hosts the React UI and communicates only through controlled preload bridges
- **Browser View** loads remote pages only in sandboxed `WebContentsView` instances created by Main, without the app preload, Node.js, or the main Renderer bridge
- **No local service** means production does not listen on TCP ports or bundle a web server

## Data, security, and privacy

- Sessions and Pi configuration remain in `~/.pi/agent/` by default
- The application does not open an additional local network port for UI communication
- The Renderer runs in the Electron sandbox with a strict Content Security Policy
- Preload exposes only controlled bridge APIs, and TypeScript contracts constrain Host RPC
- Agent Browser tools and Advanced Browser Mode are off by default; Main validates the persistent policy, temporary session grant, lease, and policy revision before any target-tool side effect
- The update client uses only the public GitHub Release configuration embedded in production builds; it accepts neither update URLs nor release credentials from the Renderer
- WeChat and Telegram use outbound-only long polling, while Feishu/Lark uses an outbound WebSocket; none opens a webhook or local listener
- Model providers determine how model request data is processed; review the privacy policy of every provider you configure

## Relationship to the Pi ecosystem

Pi Agent Desktop is a desktop workspace for Pi Coding Agent. It continues to use sessions and configuration from `~/.pi/agent/`, so it can be used alongside the CLI.

Plugins continue to load through Pi's package manager and runtime. Extension APIs that only make sense in the terminal TUI, such as custom terminal components or raw key listeners, cannot be represented equivalently in the desktop Renderer. The application reports an explicit compatibility message instead of silently ignoring them.
